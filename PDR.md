### Overview
The project involves developing a responsive website for a dog training company using React and TypeScript. The website will target first-time dog owners, adopters, and agility competition enthusiasts, providing them with relevant information, event schedules, and contact details.

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Navigation
- **Top Navigation Bar:**
  - Links to Home, Info, Race Calendar, Sponsors, and Contact pages.
  - Responsive menu for mobile devices (e.g., hamburger menu).

#### 2. Homepage
- **Hero Section:**
  - Display a banner image with a headline, introductory text, and a CTA button leading to the Info page.
  
- **Adoption Story Section:**
  - Include placeholders for images and narrative text to showcase a dog adoption story.
  
- **Upcoming Events Preview:**
  - Interactive section showing upcoming events with a CTA to the Race Calendar page.
  
- **Sponsors Display:**
  - Showcase sponsor logos in a carousel or grid format.
  
- **Footer:**
  - Present contact information and links to Instagram, Facebook, Email, and Phone.

#### 3. Info Page
- Load and display pre-existing text content dynamically from a configuration file.

#### 4. Race Calendar
- Present a visual calendar with clickable dates for event details.
- Allow filtering or searching of events (optional).

#### 5. Sponsors Page
- Display a detailed view of sponsor logos, descriptions, and links to their websites.

#### 6. Contact Page
- Provide links and icons for social media and direct contact methods.
- Optional: Include a contact form for inquiries.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 1. Technology Stack
- Use React for front-end development.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

#### 2. Performance
- Ensure fast load times and efficient rendering on various devices and connection speeds.

#### 3. Accessibility
- Adhere to accessibility standards to ensure usability for all users.

#### 4. Security
- Implement secure options for any forms or interactive features.
  
#### 5. Scalability
- Design the system to accommodate future growth in content and functionality.

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. Development Environment
- Recommended setup using Node.js for development and build processes.
- Use of a component library (e.g., Material-UI or Chakra UI) for UI consistency.

#### 2. State Management
- Decide on a state management solution, such as Redux or Context API, if necessary for complex state.

#### 3. API Integration
- Prepare for integration with any external APIs, especially if planning for dynamic content updates or features.

#### 4. Configuration
- Maintain configuration files for dynamic content loading on the Info page.

#### 5. Testing
- Implement unit and integration testing using a framework like Jest or React Testing Library.

#### Deployment 

#### 1. Hosting
- **Platform:** The website codebase will be hosted on GitHub, using a public or private repository depending on your preference.
  
#### 2. Deployment
- **Deployment Method:** Use GitHub Actions for continuous deployment.
  
- **Deployment Target:** Deploy the website to GitHub Pages, which offers free hosting for static websites and is well-integrated with GitHub repositories.

#### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Trigger:** Set up the deployment process to run automatically on certain triggers such as a push to the main branch or a successful pull request merge.
  
- **Build Process:**
  - Use Node.js setup to install dependencies via `npm install`.
  - Run build scripts using `npm run build` (or similar command tailored to your setup).

- **Deployment Script:**
  - Use a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to automate the build and deployment steps.
  - Deploy the built project files to the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages hosting.
  
#### 4. Environment Configuration
- Ensure that any environment-specific configurations (e.g., API keys or environment variables) are securely managed and, if necessary, injected during the build or deployment process.

### Sample GitHub Actions Workflow
Here's a basic example of what a GitHub Actions workflow file might look like for deploying a React app to GitHub Pages:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build
      run: npm run build

    - name: Deploy
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./build
```

### Additional Considerations
- **Branch Protection:** Consider protecting the main branch to prevent direct pushes and ensure that all changes are reviewed through pull requests.
- **Secrets Management:** Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information securely if your deployment requires any sensitive keys or tokens.
